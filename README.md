The Blocks World
===========

The Blocks World is a classic and famous toy domain in Artificial Intelligence.

Starting from an initial configuration of blocks the aim is to move blocks to a new goal configuration. Blocks are
instantaneously moved by means of a virtual gripper. A block can only be moved if there is no other block sitting
on top of it. A block can always be moved to the table.
